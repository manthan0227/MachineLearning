# Finding Address on Google Map

I used the opencv to detect the text from the image. Then using `Google Map API` to find the address on `Google Map`

## Example 1:
#### First take the image which has text "Gift City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat"
![text](images/1.png)
#### We detect the text using tesseract library after that we give the text to the google api to find the address on map. 
#### Output:
![alt text](images/GiftCity/g1.png)
![alt text](images/GiftCity/g2.png)


## Example 2:
#### Here we take the image which has text "Naroda road, Ahmedabad, Gujarat"
![alt text](images/2.png)
#### Output:
![alt text](images/Naroda/n2.png)![alt text](images/Naroda/n2.png)
